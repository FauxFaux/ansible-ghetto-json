ghetto_json
===========

Need a quick way to edit a JSON file in Ansible?  Ansible has great built-in support for
 ini files, but a number of more modern applications are using JSON for config files.

ghetto_json lets you make some types of edits to JSON files, and remains simple enough that
  it's hopefully easier just to extend than to switch to a different module, and you won't feel
  too guilty just copy-pasting it into your codebase.


Installation
------------

Drop ``ghetto_json`` into your playbook's ``library`` folder,
 which can be [configured](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html#library)
 but defaults to ``./library`` inside a playbook.

Synopsis
--------

Make in-place changes to simple JSON documents,
 without having to resort to ``replace``.


Requirements
------------

Python 2.7 may be required for some ``shlex`` functionality
 (like working Unicode), which you probably don't care about.


Options
-------

#### path:

The file on the target to edit.

#### all other options:

A very simple object notation for the location of the property to edit,
 and its new value.

Mandatory automatic conversion will be applied. Supported values:

 * integers (``5``, ``-17``)
 * ``true`` / ``false``
 * ``null``
 * ``unset`` will delete the key


Examples
--------

For the example JSON document ``/foo/bar.json`` containing:
````
{ "a": 5, "b": {"c": 6, "d": "hello" } }
````

...you can run an invocation like:
````
 - ghetto_json:
    path=/foo/bar.json
    a=7
    b.c=yellow
    b.d=unset
````

...and the file will be left looking like:

````
{
  "a": 7,
  "b": {
    "c": "yellow"
  }
}
````
